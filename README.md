# mandala

*codename*

A game about making conditions for life to exist.

You are never told what you are. You infer it from the mechanics, the scale, the texture
of the world around you. You build with care. When the work is done, it dissolves.
You begin again.

Seven levels. Seven organisms. One patch of earth across deep time.
